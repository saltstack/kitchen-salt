A Test Kitchen Provisioner for Salt

The provider works by generating a salt-minion config, creating pillars based on attributes in .kitchen.yml and calling salt-call.

This provisioner is tested with kitchen-docker against CentOS, Ubuntu, and Debian.

## Generate and locally view kitchen-salt docs ##

To view the docs that were originally generated by this repository and hosted by Salt Project, the following should generate a local copy of the documentation.

    # Clear any locally generated documentation
    rm -rf html/

    # Generate HTML documentation of kitchen-salt
    bundle install
    bundle exec yard doc
    firefox html/index.html

    # OPTIONAL
    # Start a local http server to view the rendered docs
    # Accessible via http://localhost:8808/
    bundle exec yard server docroot=html/
